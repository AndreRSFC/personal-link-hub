# Project Reflection

## Did you use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? If so, how?

I utilized both GitHub Copilot and Claude during my development process. My approach was to leverage these tools primarily for routine, repetitive tasks and to gather initial ideas for implementation approaches. However, I was careful to always evaluate the suggestions and never blindly integrate entire solutions. The AI tools were particularly helpful for generating boilerplate code and suggesting implementation patterns, but I always reviewed and modified the output to ensure it aligned with my project architecture and coding standards.

## What did you build or decide manually?

Almost the entire project was built through manual coding and decision-making. From the application architecture to component structure, routing logic, and state management approaches, these were all products of my own critical thinking. The only major technology decision significantly influenced by AI suggestions was the adoption of Supabase, which appeared to be the most efficient solution given the project timeline constraints.

## Where did you need to think critically or make decisions beyond AI suggestions?

Critical thinking was essential throughout the development process, particularly in areas such as:

- API caching strategies and implementation using React Query
- State management architecture and deciding when to use local state versus global state
- Component design and deciding what to build from scratch versus using libraries
- Folder structure and organization to ensure maintainability
- Implementation of best practices for authentication flows and security
- Designing drag-and-drop functionality for link reordering
- Balancing feature development against time constraints

These decisions required weighing various technical approaches against project requirements and considering future maintainability.

## What would you improve with more time?

With additional time, I would enhance the project in several ways:

- Implement comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, and E2E tests with Playwright)
- Standardize CSS variables in a theme system with potential dark mode support
- Refactor complex components (particularly the links-section) into smaller, more maintainable units
- Improve error handling with standardized patterns across the application
- Add user feedback mechanisms like toast notifications for operations
- Centralize frequently used data in global state (e.g., user profile information)
- Incorporate form validation libraries for more robust input handling
- Consider adopting a UI component library for consistency and development speed
- Replace fetch with Axios for better request interceptors and error handling
- Add observability tooling for production monitoring
- Expand authentication options (social logins, 2FA, password strength validation)
- Establish a CI/CD pipeline with semantic versioning and quality gates
- Implement loading states with skeleton UI to prevent layout shifts
- Add internationalization support with i18next
- Potentially separate frontend and backend into distinct repositories
- Create documentation including API specifications, coding standards, and architectural decisions
- Integrate user analytics tools like Amplitude
- Avoid using 'any' type and implement shared type definitions between the API and client side, ensuring type consistency across the entire application**

These improvements would enhance both the developer experience and end-user satisfaction with the application.
